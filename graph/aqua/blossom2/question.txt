In JavaScript, using "use strict" trades some flexibility with the speed,
I have noticed that specifying numerical key in an object results in conversion
from integer to string. And when accessed or referenced, the object takes
both integer and string as its key.
The example is as below

var a = {};
a[1] = 0;

1 in a;
//returns true
"1" in a;
//also returns true

Is there a way to inhibit this behavior?
